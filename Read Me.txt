For this Assignment, I developed a Weather Application that utilizes the OpenWeather API to gather current weather data and a 5-day forecast for a specified city.

 I designed the application to include a chatbot capable of responding to predefined weather-related questions. 
This adds an interactive element that enhances user experience.

 I also incorporated filtering functionalities that allow users to access specific weather data, such as identifying the hottest day or filtering for rainy days, as well as sorting temperature lists.

To break down the project into manageable steps, I started with API integration,
 where I connected the OpenWeather API to fetch both current weather data and a 5-day forecast. Once the data was accessible, 
I implemented dynamic data display so that details like the city name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed could update on the webpage in real time. 
Next, I added the chatbot, which I programmed to recognize common weather-related intents—like "What is the weather today?" and "Hottest Day?"—while also rejecting unrelated queries, such as sports questions.

I ensured that the application fetches the 5-day forecast and displays it in a user-friendly grid format. 



To enhance user experience further, I included error handling to manage situations like invalid city names or API request failures. 
Additionally, I optimized API calls to prevent unnecessary requests when the input remains unchanged. For the filtering functions, 
I implemented features to find the hottest day, filter out rainy days, and sort temperatures in both ascending and descending order.

Overall, the chatbot recognizes a variety of predefined intents related to weather, including queries about rain, humidity, and temperature. 
This project not only honed my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of how to create user-friendly applications that respond to real-world needs

we will run the index.html file to run this project. linking has alrwady  been done. linking to open weather Api Api has Already been done by me.

intents for chat bot have also been added in chatbot code - pre defined as guided on GCR
